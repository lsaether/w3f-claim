		<p>A key concept to understand is that you are actually generating two
			<code class="text-primary bg-gray">“keys”</code>
			(strings of characters),
			<code class="text-primary bg-gray">one public</code>
			(the address) and
			<code class="text-primary bg-gray">one
				private</code>
			(your seed). A useful analogy is a mailroom at the post office. Anybody with your address can send you mail, or
			put mail in your mailbox, but you need your private key to open your mailbox and move your mail. Similarly,
			anybody with your Polkadot address can send you dots, but to do anything with those dots in your account, you will
			need to have your seed (or an application in which you have already entered it).</p>
		</p>
		<p>Your Polkadot address can be shared publicly, but you should never reveal your seed. If somebody has your
			address, they could send you dots or associate your real-world identity with on-chain actions. However, this
			information would not allow them to harm your account or do anything in your name.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6 mb-4">
		<p>If somebody has access to your seed, they have complete control over your account! This means that they can
			do anything that you could do, including transfer all of your dots to a different account. Neither Web3
			Foundation nor anyone else will be able to recover your dots in such a situation.</p>
		<p>Bearing that in mind, we recommended that you do not store your seed anywhere on a digital device which can be
			connected to a network. It should be written down on paper and only entered when necessary. It should never be
			shared with anybody - again, if anyone has access to your seed, they will have complete control over your
			account.</p>
