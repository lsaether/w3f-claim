					<div class="col-12 col-md-6">
						<p>Obtain an iOS or Android device. Note that this device will need to be used solely for this purpose. That
							is,
							you will “convert” your device into a storage mechanism for interacting with your DOTs. It will not be
							usable
							for other functionality (e.g. browsing the Internet, making phone calls, running other apps, etc.)
						</p>
						<p>Perform a full factory reset on your device.</p>
						<p>Ensure that you set a strong password that cannot be easily guessed. It is recommended that you do not
							use
							biometric security such as keypress access or facial recognition.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-12 col-md-6">
						<p>If this is an iOS device or a newer Android device, full-disk encryption should already be on by default.
							If it
							is an older Android device, turn on full-disk encryption. Note that this may take a long time (an hour or
							more)
							and turning the system off midway through will cause you to lose all data. The instructions for turning on
							full-disk encryption here:
							<a href="#">https://source.android.com/security/encryption/full-disk</a>.

						<p>Connect to the Apple Store or Google Play store and search for the Parity Signer app.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="col-12 col-md-6">
						<p>After the application is installed, you should then turn on Airplane Mode and turn off all wireless
							connectivity options (generally, wifi and Bluetooth). This will minimize the “attack surface” of the phone
							-
							that is, it will reduce the number of ways that an attacker could gain access to your phone. Eliminating
							network
							connectivity means that an attacker would need to have physical access to your phone in order to access
							your
							key.
						</p>
						<p>Note that although Parity Signer will work with network connectivity, you will see a message indicating
							that
							you are “Not Secure”. You can use Parity Signer without turning off network connectivity, but is not
							recommended
							as it is then possible for others to potentially remotely access the phone and obtain your seed.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-12 col-md-6">
						<p>After this, it is recommended that you use this phone only for accessing your account. It will be able to
							unlock your account by signing transactions without ever exposing your seed to a device connected to a
							network.
							All communication will be done through a very limited communication pathway (displaying and scanning QR
							codes).

					<div class="col-12 col-md-6">
						<p>This may sound repetitive, but it is important to realize that your seed is the key to your entire
							account.
							Someone who knows your seed has uncontested control over your account.
						</p>
						<p>On the other hand, if you lose your seed, and your mobile device fails, you will have no way of accessing
							your
							account. The Web3 Foundation will not be able to override this - any DOTs in that account will not be
							accessible
							to you until you find the seed.</p>
						<p>Thus, it is imperative to store the seed somewhere safe, secret, and secure. If your device fails for
							some
							reason, you can simply re-enter your seed on a new device after following the setup instructions here, and
							have
							access to your account once again.</p>
						<p>For maximum security, the seed should be written down on paper or another non-digital device and stored
							in a
							safe place. You may also want to protect your seed from physical damage, as well (e.g. by storing in a
							sealed
							plastic bag to prevent water damage, storing it in a fireproof safe, etc.) It is recommended that you
							store
							multiple copies of the seed in geographically separate locations (e.g., one in your home safe and one in a
							safety deposit box at your bank).
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-12 col-md-6">
						<p>You should definitely not store your seed on any kind of computer which has or may have access to the
							Internet
							in the future.</p>
						<p>When you have finished, click on “Backup Done”.</p>
						<p>You will have to verify that you have written down your seed before moving on. Remember, if you have not
							written down your seed, and your device breaks or is otherwise unavailable, you will not able to access
							your
							DOTs or do anything from this account.</p>
